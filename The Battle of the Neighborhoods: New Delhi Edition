Explore the neighborhoods of New Delhi and suggest popular places to eat.

Introduction/Business Understanding:

Ahead of the season of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the cricket tournament that takes place in India, people from all over the
world come to witness their favorite teams and players. Although there are multiple venues but New Delhi being the capitsl city of India
sees a surge in quite a large number of tourists from outside and from different parts of the country. To provide a solution to the search
for the best eateries in the city, I leverage the FourSquare API, Machine Learning and visualization tools to achieve this goal.

In this project, I am going to Geocode location data obtained from WikiPedia and clustering methods to group the neighborhoods and sugest best eateries/restaurants for every taste in the city.
